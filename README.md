# stock-analysis
In this module, you'll be helping your good friend Steve, who's just graduated with his finance degree. His parents couldn't be prouder. They're so proud in fact, that they're going to be his first clients. 

Because Steve's parents are passionate about green energy, they have decided to invest all their money into DAQO New Energy Corporation, a company that makes silicon wafers for solar panels. But Steve thinks that his parents' funds should be more diversified, so he wants to analyze several green energy stocks, in addition to DAQO stock.

Steve has given you an Excel file containing the stock data he wants you to analyze. We'll be using an extension to Excel, built to automate tasks: Visual Basic for Applications, usually referred to as VBA.

VBA is a programming language that interacts with Excel. It can read and write to cells and worksheets, make calculations, and use complex logic to perform analyses. Using code to automate analyses will allow Steve to reuse it with any stock, and reduces the chance of accidents and errors.
