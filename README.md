# stock-analysis
In this module, you'll be helping your good friend Steve, who's just graduated with his finance degree. His parents couldn't be prouder. They're so proud in fact, that they're going to be his first clients. 

Because Steve's parents are passionate about green energy, they have decided to invest all their money into DAQO New Energy Corporation, a company that makes silicon wafers for solar panels. But Steve thinks that his parents' funds should be more diversified, so he wants to analyze several green energy stocks, in addition to DAQO stock.

Steve has given you an Excel file containing the stock data he wants you to analyze. We'll be using an extension to Excel, built to automate tasks: Visual Basic for Applications, usually referred to as VBA.

VBA is a programming language that interacts with Excel. It can read and write to cells and worksheets, make calculations, and use complex logic to perform analyses. Using code to automate analyses will allow Steve to reuse it with any stock, and reduces the chance of accidents and errors. 

## Challenge

Steve loves the workbook you prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although your code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

In this challenge, you’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written analysis that explains your findings.

Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be your entry point to working with the existing code at a job.
